Very often I find myself in situations where a heavy weight decision is required to be made.
A decision that will have a long lasting impact on our software system. 
For example the question of whether we should split up our team when approaching multi tenancy or stick to one large team responsible for every tenant.
It is in those situations that I have some strong gut feeling towards an answer or against another.
It is very unfortunate if I cannot undermine those feelings with facts or experiences which I can point to.
Nevertheless, I realized that the gut feeling did turn out to be true more often than not.
This is something I want to shine more of a light on in the future: 
The next time such a situation comes up, I intend to announce my gut feeling, also as such.
In addition I will write it down including all the info and arguments I can come up with (if any).
I will want to come back to those in the later future and reflect on them.
Based on that empirical data I might have a higher chance of successfully analysing the core of those feelings.
Also I might be able to argue better for my feelings or to immediately reflect on why they might be wrong.



1. should we split up our team when approaching multi tenancy or stick to one large team responsible for every tenant?

* my gut feeling was: 
  * we should not try to maintain a large team (~10 pax) where everyone is "interchangeable" and could work on any tenant at any point in time.
  * I felt an approach with responsibilities split up between tenants is faster and more effective. also it allows individuals to identify with "their" domain. especially since our domain as a whole is super complex.
  * I saw the risk of the one team being overwhelmed and no single person can quickly dig deep into particular domain aspects. 
* what we went with:
  * one large team with everyone being interchangeable
