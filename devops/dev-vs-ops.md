# Why do I prefer developers in a DevOps position?

Developers bring a mindset of constant change and the experience on how to handle it to the table.

Continuous change is the norm in a modern software application. Classically operations or system administrators focus on stability. That inherently leads to preferring no changes in a running system. Which builds a mindset of stagnation.

A developers job is to change software, always. All a developer needs to learn is operations tooling and technology. 

Bottom line, when trying to nourish a DevOps environment bring together dev and ops. However let the developers focus on how we do things and the operations on what we do.
